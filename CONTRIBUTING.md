## Formatting

We use our company's IntelliJ code style for the project, which is very similar to the official Kotlin Android code style. When submitting
code please make sure you use the proper format. You can install the code style into Android Studio by running the script
in `./config/androidstudio/install-codestyle.sh`. Then restart Android Studio and pick the "AdevintaAndroid" schema in preferences.
